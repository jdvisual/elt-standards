# Contributing

## How to Propose Changes
1. Create a branch from `main`
2. Make edits
3. Submit a Pull Request
4. Request review from the document owner (listed at top of each doc)

## Rules
- Do not commit secrets, credentials, or internal URLs
- Keep docs tool-agnostic unless explicitly required
- Prefer small PRs with clear scope
- Update the Changelog when changes are notable

## Document Requirements
Each doc must include:
- **Status:** Proposed / Approved / Deprecated
- **Owner:** team or role responsible
